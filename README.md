# Centroid 2D
A package to find the area weighted center of a convex polygon whose mass is evenly distributed across the surface.

## API

```js
const findCentroid = require('centroid2d)

let polygon = [
    [0, 0],
    [5, 0],
    [5, 5],
    [0, 5],
]
let centroid = findCentroid(polygon) // [2.5, 2.5]
```

Input must be an array of arrays of x and y coordinates.

There is no typechecking for simplicity and speed.
